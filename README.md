# Team Profile Generator: Dunder Mifflin Office Directory

## Description

This project is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. A user can enter any number of team members, assigning them roles such as 'Manager', 'Engineer', or 'Intern' and depending on which role is selected, different information is generated. The final HTML output is styled so that Dunder Mifflin Regional Managers can easily created their office directories.
